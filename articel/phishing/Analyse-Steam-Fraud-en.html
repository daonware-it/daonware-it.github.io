    <h1 id="report">Steam Account Scam: Analysis, Method & Protection</h1>
    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>The digital world offers countless opportunities for interaction and entertainment, but also harbors risks in the form of cybercrime. Online gaming platforms like Steam are frequent targets for scammers trying to obtain sensitive user data. This report analyzes a typical scam attempt based on psychological manipulation and the presentation of false facts. The goal is to detail the <strong>modus operandi</strong> of the perpetrators and present effective protection measures.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="modus-operandi">1. Modus Operandi: How the Scam Works</h2>

    The scam described here follows a clear pattern aimed at putting the victim under time pressure and persuading them to disclose sensitive information.

    <h3 id="initial-contact">1.1 Initial Contact by Fake Accounts 🕵️‍♂️</h3>

    <div style="display:flex; justify-content:center; margin-bottom:1.5em;">
      <figure style="background:#f8f9fa; border-radius:16px; box-shadow:0 4px 16px #ddd; padding:1em; max-width:420px;">
        <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/github-storage-daonware/Scam/Steam-Scam/discord_profile_fake.png" alt="Fake Discord Profile" style="border-radius:12px; width:100%; box-shadow:0 2px 8px #bbb;">
        <figcaption style="text-align:center; color:#666; font-size:1em; margin-top:0.5em;">
          <span style="font-weight:500;">Fake Discord profile of an alleged Valve employee</span>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    The first step of the scam is contact by fake profiles. The perpetrators pose as official employees of Valve, the operator of Steam. They use:

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fake profiles:</strong> These often feature supposed "verified checkmarks" to suggest authenticity. The profile <strong>Matt (Official Valve) ✅</strong> with the username <strong>steamvalve_adminofficialmatt</strong> and an "About Me" section claiming long-term membership since <strong>April 4, 2008</strong>, even though the profile has only existed since <strong>July 27, 2025</strong>, is a clear example. The link "<a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/</a>" is meant to inspire trust, as it is a legitimate Steam site.</li>
      <li><strong>Impressive names:</strong> Names like <strong>Matt (Official Valve)</strong> or usernames like <strong>steamvalve_adminofficialmatt</strong> are intended to create the impression of a legitimate Steam community representative or a direct Valve employee.</li>
    </ul>

    <div align="center">
      <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/github-storage-daonware/Scam/Steam-Scam/discord_profile_fake.png" alt="Fake Discord Profile" style="max-width:420px; width:100%; border-radius:12px; box-shadow:0 2px 8px #bbb;">
    </div>

    <h3 id="manipulation">1.2 Psychological Manipulation 🎭</h3>

    <div style="display:flex; justify-content:center; margin-bottom:1.5em;">
      <figure style="background:#f8f9fa; border-radius:16px; box-shadow:0 4px 16px #ddd; padding:1em; max-width:420px;">
        <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/github-storage-daonware/Scam/Steam-Scam/steam_fake_message_1.png" alt="Fake Steam Message 1" style="border-radius:12px; width:100%; box-shadow:0 2px 8px #bbb;">
        <figcaption style="text-align:center; color:#666; font-size:1em; margin-top:0.5em;">
          <span style="font-weight:500;">Fake Steam message with time pressure</span>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    The core of the scam is targeted psychological manipulation of the victim. Scammers use various tactics:

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Time pressure:</strong> One of the most effective methods is the threat of a supposed deadline of a few hours (e.g., <strong>3 hours</strong>), within which the account will be banned if immediate action is not taken. This is meant to create panic and prevent rational thinking. In the chat log, <strong>Matt (Official Valve)</strong> repeatedly refers to the <strong>pending ban</strong> and demands quick action.</li>
      <div align="center">
        <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/github-storage-daonware/Scam/Steam-Scam/steam_fake_message_1.png" alt="Fake Steam Message 1" style="max-width:420px; width:100%; border-radius:12px; box-shadow:0 2px 8px #bbb; margin-bottom:1em;">
        <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/github-storage-daonware/Scam/Steam-Scam/steam_fake_message_2.png" alt="Fake Steam Message 2" style="max-width:420px; width:100%; border-radius:12px; box-shadow:0 2px 8px #bbb;">
      </div>
      <li><strong>Abuse of authority:</strong> The scammer presents himself as an official Valve employee ("I am Matt from Steam Community Valve"), making the victim believe it is a serious and unavoidable matter.</li>
      <li><strong>Intimidation:</strong> Explicit threats of permanent account bans ("if I don't call you, then my account is banned") are used to further unsettle the victim and force cooperation.</li>
      <li><strong>False legitimacy:</strong> To make the scam more credible, fake "Years of Service" badges and forged Steam profiles are presented, such as the claim "worked on Steam since April 4, 2008" in the profile of "Matt (Official Valve)".</li>
    </ul>

    <div style="display:flex; justify-content:center; margin-bottom:1.5em;">
      <figure style="background:#f8f9fa; border-radius:16px; box-shadow:0 4px 16px #ddd; padding:1em; max-width:420px;">
        <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/github-storage-daonware/Scam/Steam-Scam/fake_admin_account.png" alt="Fake Steam Admin Profile" style="border-radius:12px; width:100%; box-shadow:0 2px 8px #bbb;">
        <figcaption style="text-align:center; color:#666; font-size:1em; margin-top:0.5em;">

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <h3 id="procedure">1.3 Detailed Procedure</h3>

    After the victim has been unsettled by the initial contact and psychological manipulation, the scammers demand concrete actions:

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Allegation of illegal activities:</strong> It is claimed that the account has been reported for alleged "illegal activity." "daonware" mentions in the chat having received a message that his Steam account was reported.</li>
      <li><strong>Request for screenshots of the purchase history – the central element for account takeover:</strong> The victim is asked to send screenshots of the Steam purchase history, supposedly to verify the allegations. "Matt (Official Valve)" explicitly requests: "May I have a screenshot of your purchases history list and please do include the name of the owner's, so I can program it and scan if it's been used legally." and refers to a real Steam link: <br>
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color:#0066cc; text-decoration:underline;">https://store.steampowered.com/account/history/</a><br>
    
        <div style="background:#fffbe6; border-radius:12px; box-shadow:0 2px 8px #f7e9b7; padding:1.2em 1.5em; margin:1.2em 0;">
          <h3 style="margin-top:0; color:#b8860b;">🖼️ Why screenshots of the purchase history are dangerous</h3>
          <ul style="list-style:none; padding-left:0; font-size:1.08em;">
            <li>🎭 <strong>Visual manipulation:</strong> Scammers use visual elements in chat screenshots to create the impression of official Steam Support messages. This includes a button labeled "Active Ban Report" and an area called "View Ban History" that appears empty. These elements are meant to reinforce the authenticity of the alleged "investigation" and further manipulate the victim.</li>
            <li>🔓 <strong>Account takeover through data abuse:</strong> The main reason attackers request this history is to take over the Steam account. The purchase history, with details about games, purchase dates, and payment methods (such as PayPal emails or credit card endings), is an important verification feature for real Steam Support to confirm account ownership. With this information, the attacker can convincingly claim to Steam Support to be the rightful owner of an account that was stolen or hacked, request a password reset, and gain control of the account.</li>
            <li>📝 <strong>Request for personal data:</strong> Under the pretext of "verification," personal data is requested, such as the explicit demand to show the owner's name in the screenshots.</li>
            <li>📨 <strong>Fake messages:</strong> Fake messages from alleged <strong>VALVE FRAUD MODERATORS</strong> are sent to reinforce the scam and give the victim the impression of communicating with multiple official parties.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>What is a screenshot of the purchase history?</strong><br>
    The purchase history shows all games and items a user has bought on Steam, including payment data. A screenshot of this is an image showing this information. These data are very sensitive, as they are used for identity verification by Steam Support.</p>

    Despite the sophistication of the scammers, there are clear technical and communicative warning signals that can expose a scam attempt:

    <div style="background:#fffbe6; border-radius:12px; box-shadow:0 2px 8px #f7e9b7; padding:1.2em 1.5em; margin:2em 0;">
      <h3 style="margin-top:0; color:#b8860b;">🚨 Typical warning signals of a scam chat</h3>
      <ul style="list-style:none; padding-left:0; font-size:1.08em;">
        <li>💬 <strong>Unprofessional communication:</strong> The chat from "Matt (Official Valve)" uses a colloquial tone ("Excuse me, what do you mean data?") that would not be appropriate for official communication.</li>
        <li>🔄 <strong>Contradictory statements and excuses:</strong> When "daonware" logically asks why "Matt" cannot simply view the data in the "Admin Interface" or "Dashboard," the scammer responds evasively: "Our panel is currently investigating at this moment, so you only need to follow the instructions to remove the pending ban, understood?" The argument that the data are needed for "programming" and "scanning" is implausible.</li>
        <li>🔗 <strong>Fake link:</strong> Links included in the messages, such as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color:#b8860b; text-decoration:underline;">https://store.steampowered.com/account/history/</a> (which does lead to the real site, but is used in the context of a scam to persuade the victim to disclose data), serve as deception.</li>
        <li>🎭 <strong>Visual deception:</strong> Forged Steam profiles with fake badges are a visual indicator of a scam, such as the discrepancy between the stated <strong>Member since (July 27, 2025)</strong> and the claimed <strong>Worked on Steam since April 4, 2008</strong> of the fake profile <strong>Matt (Official Valve)</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="goal">2. The Goal of the Scam 🎯</h2>

    <p><strong>What are inventory items?</strong><br>
    Inventory items are digital goods that users own in games, e.g., weapon skins, trading cards, or equipment. Some of these are very valuable and can be traded or sold.</p>

    The ultimate goal of these scam attempts is always the theft of assets or harm to the victim:

    
    <div style="background:#fffbe6; border-radius:12px; box-shadow:0 2px 8px #f7e9b7; padding:1.2em 1.5em; margin:2em 0;">
      <h3 style="margin-top:0; color:#b8860b;">🎯 Typical goals of a Steam scam</h3>
      <ul style="list-style:none; padding-left:0; font-size:1.08em;">
        <li>🕵️‍♂️ <strong>Data theft:</strong> The primary aim is to steal login data for the Steam account and gain insight into the purchase history, which reveals personal information and payment patterns.</li>
        <li>🔓 <strong>Account takeover:</strong> With the stolen data, scammers gain full control over the victim's Steam account.</li>
        <li>📢 <strong>Further scam distribution:</strong> The hacked account is often used to spread more scams by contacting the victim's friends or other users.</li>
        <li>💸 <strong>Financial damage:</strong> By accessing the account, scammers can use stored payment methods or sell valuable inventory items (skins, goods) and keep the proceeds.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion 📝</h2>

    <p>
      The analyzed Steam scam attempt exemplifies how scammers use psychological pressure and feigned authority to obtain sensitive data. Despite increasingly sophisticated methods, the basic principles of the scam remain recognizable: <strong>pressure, urgency, and the demand for data via unofficial channels</strong>. The perpetrators even invest in deceptively realistic visual elements to make their scam attempts appear more credible.
    </p>

    
    <div style="background:#fff3e0; border-radius:10px; box-shadow:0 1px 4px #ffd699; padding:1em 1.2em; margin:2em 0;">
      <strong>⚠️ Note:</strong> Always be suspicious if you are put under pressure or asked to disclose information via insecure channels.<br>
      Only share sensitive data via official channels.<br>
      <span style="font-weight:500;">Vigilance and consistently following basic security measures are the best protection against such attacks.</span>
